 <p> Anime, in the Western world, is a word for a style of animation produced in Japan. On the contrary though, in Japan anime is a word
   used to refer to all forms of animation,regardless of style or origin. Anime is synonymously known for it's
   representation of vibrant, outrageous and unique characters, which are very captivating in the eyes of the viewers.</p>
   <p> Although there are different genres,series,adaptations and opinions on the internet, anime is not the easiest thing to get into. In
     fact, it is for that very reason that it may be hard diving into Japanese animation. </p>
     <p> Luckily though I have put together tips and recommendations for a fellow aspiring weeb, who wishes to learn more about this
     exciting new world. </p>

<h2>Where do i even start?</h2>
The first step is to determine what type of genre you are into. A common mistake every beginner makes is watching certain series just
  because it is popular. By finding the genre best suited for you you narrow down your list of options, and make it easier to browse through
  them.It is good to start off by watching anime with fewer episodes, then later switch to watching ones out of your comfort zone. If you are
  unsure, you can check out the <a href="https://myotakuworld.com/all-anime-genres-meaning/"> different genres and their meanings.
